    FLOW: Sensors -> Perception -> Planning -> Control


Subsystem: Sensors
    - Sensors are the hardware components your car uses to observe the world.
    - Which sensors belong on the sensor Subsystem?
        Ans: GPS, IMU, Radar, and Ultrasonic Sensors.

Subsystem: Perception
    - Process data from sensors into structured information.
    - Info can then be used by path planning or control.

    Perception Subsystem A: Detection
        - Responsible for understanding world around it
        - Detection Types: Object, Lane, Traffic Sign, Traffic Light, Free Space
        - Components: Camera, Radar, Lidar

    Perception Subsystem B: Localization
        - Responsible for using sensor and map data to determine vehicle's location
        - Lidar is primarily used for Localization

    How are Sensor Subsystem and Perception Subsystem connected?

    Perception:
        1. Lane Detection - Camera
        2. Traffic Light Detection & Classification - Camera
        3. Traffic Sign Detection & Classification - Camera
        4. Object Detection and Tracking - Lidar, Camera, Radar
        5. Free Space Detection - Lidar
        6. Localization (Where am I?) - Lidar, GPS

Subsystem: Planning

    Planning Subsystems

        1. Route Planning
            - Responsible for high-level decisions about the path of the 
                vehicle between two points on a map.
            - Component is similar to the route planning feature found on 
                many smartphones or modern car navigation systems.
            
        2. Prediction
            - Prediction component estimates what actions other objects might 
                take in the future. 
            - If another vehicle were identified, the prediction component 
                would estimate its trajectory

        3. Behavioural Planning
            -  Behavioural planning component determines what behaviour the vehicle 
                should exhibit at any point in time
            -  E.g Lane Change, Accelerating, Making left turn, all maneuvers.

        4. Trajectory Planning
            -  Based on the desired immediate behaviour, the trajectory planning component 
                will determine which trajectory is best for executing this behaviour.

        What perception components provide useful info about the prediction component?
            Ans: Lane Detection, Free Space Detection, Vehicle Detection, 
                Traffic Sign Classification, Localization.

        What perception components provide useful info about the behaviour planning component?
            Ans: Lane Detection, Free Space Detection, Vehicle Detection, 
                Traffic Sign Classification, Localization.

        
        Planning:
            Route Planning  - Map 
            Prediction - Lane Detection, Traffic Light & Object Detection
            Behavioural Planning - Lane Detection, Free Space Detection, 
                                Traffic Sign Classification, Localization.
            Trajectory Planning - Lane Detection, Object Detection, Free Space Detection

Subsystem: Control 

    - Software to ensure plan is executed by car. May include:
        1. PID Controller
        2. Model Predictive Controller
        3. Other Controllers

        Sends: Acceleration, Braking, Steering Data

    Waypoints: Target Navigation Points 
        - Used to Avoid Obstacles and Stop at Traffic Lights
        
        What are Waypoints:
            Ans: Ordered set of coordinates that Karla uses to plan a path around the track
        
            - Each waypoint also has an associated target velocity
            - Planning subsytsem  updates the target velocity for waypoints ahead of vehicle
             depending on desired vehicle location.
            - Control subsytsem navigates the waypoints with the correct target velocity

        - Recieves Info from Perception and slows down if there is a red light for e.g
    
    Control Subsystem: Drive by Wire ROS Node
        - Takes target trajectory information as input and send controls command
